      <p>
        I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo whoâ€™s passionate about blending technology, design, and real-world impact.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve built tools for railway systems, explored AI in healthcare, and even designed a virtual closet powered by fashion data from TikTok. My goal? To keep learning, building, and collaborating on things that matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, youâ€™ll probably find me checking out vintage stores, trying new cafÃ©s, or playing volleyball, badminton or tennis.
